## Disclaimer

- My code is ugly, but because I code for fun, I ain't gonna care much.
- This project isn't intended for public use, as it is more or less just a proof-of-concept than an actual work. 
I may revisit this to implement more features, but as of right now, it only serves one single purpose.
